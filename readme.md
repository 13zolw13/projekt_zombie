In this project, I created zombie CRUD. Users can view a list of zombies, zombie details like name and creation date. Users can view zombie inventory, pick currency in which the total value of items is displayed and add new items, restricted to a maximum of 5 items. 
 I use external APIs to get the current price of items in PLN, which have to be requested once a day and daily exchange rates from NBP. 

The technology used in this project: was javascript, Node.js and MongoDB Tests written in Mocha.
